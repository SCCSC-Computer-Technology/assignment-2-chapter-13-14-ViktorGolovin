Viktor Golovin code review by Aaron Rash

Good use of comments, your code is easy to read and follow

problem 4: Works great no issues

problem #5: Program crashes if either textbox (morethan & lessthan) is not filled out/filled incorrectly.
	just add some error handling by throwing the text parsing (line 40-41) inside a try/catch or an if statement
	I'd also reccomend adding a 'clear' or 'reset' button, but that wasnt required
	otherwise program works great
	
problem 6: Same as problem #5, if min/max are left blank or filled incorrectly it crashes. Just add error handling and it works perfect.
